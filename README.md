# Module3 / Project12 / Common Web APIs 


Please make different notes with different usernames and see how they are saved on the user. You can put any password in the password input field.

## Project Brief

* Create a two page website in one HTML file that dose the following: 
* Navigate between them
* With each page change the history Web API should be used to push a new state and change the URL
* The website should contain a way to store certain information in the localStorage and then retrieve it in the next visit

## The Goal

* Understand what is a Web API
* Understand how to get information about Web APIs
* Understand what is a Single Page Application (SPA)

* Be able to use the location and history Web APIs
* Be able to use the localStorage Web APIs
* Be able to create a SPA with pure Javascript



## Intro

One of the Theme ideas for this project was a password protected note taking website which I chose to do. The project was really intereseting and I was able to use some components that I had used in previous projects which was really nice. It was nice to learn about Web APIs and how they work so overall a nice project. 

## The Process

I started designing the layout in <strong>Figma</strong>. When I was finished I wrote the HTML code, next I moved to the functional part if it in Javascript and finally I styled everything in CSS. 

## The Journey

I did not put alot of emphasize on the design which I usually do, just because I kinda am power through the rest of the projects and I wanted to focus alot on the JavaScript. Creating a two page website in a single HTML file was cool and having to manipulate it through the JavaScript was really cool. I learned alot in this project, how to clear forms, focusing on a input field and of cours all the Web APIs and how to save information on a username which was cool. 

## Features and functions

There are a lot of features and functions that I used in JavaScript:

* Event listeners on the buttons. 
* Different states on the sites depanding on where you are. 
* Different URLs depanding on where you are. 
* Save the notes that you wrote behind your username
* Put the username in the greeting message when you log in. 
* Clear input fields when you logout
* Error message when you do not fill in the input fields
* Focus on the username input field on the login page


## The Conclusion

JavaScript is an amazing tool to make a stale website more interactive as well as computing data and add to the DOM. I learned alot by doing this project and I like how it works. I look forward to learn more JavaScript and I am excited to use other Javascript framework libriaries like React.
